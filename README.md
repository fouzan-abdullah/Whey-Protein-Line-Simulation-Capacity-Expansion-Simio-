### Whey-Protein-Line-Simulation-Capacity-Expansion-Simio-

Simulated a whey protein powder production line to reduce processing delays and optimize resource utilization. Used Simio to validate models and test ROI-driven capacity changes.
Key Features:
•	Reduced time-in-system by 64.7% (146 → 51.5 mins), WIP by 74.2% (155 → 40 units).
•	Modeled 3-flavor, 4-stage production with triage logic for sanitization, flavor-dependent routing.
•	Added 1 mixing and 1 weighing station; achieved $208.6K annual profit increase and 3.7-month payback.
•	Validated results with t-tests and statistical process metrics.
Tools & Skills: Simio, Discrete-Event Simulation, Excel, Statistical Analysis, Lean Manufacturing
